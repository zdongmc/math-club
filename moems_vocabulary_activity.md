## **Opening: Detective Briefing (5 minutes)**

**Teacher Introduction:**
"Welcome to the Number Detective Academy! Today you'll solve mathematical mysteries using precise vocabulary. In math competitions like MOEMS, using the exact right terms can mean the difference between a correct and incorrect answer. Your mission: master the language that unlocks mathematical secrets!"

**Team Formation:** 
- Divide class into teams of 3-4 students
- Each team gets a "Detective Badge" (name tag) and answer sheets

---

## **Station 1: "The Case of the Missing Definitions" (6 minutes)**

### **Challenge Type:** Vocabulary Matching Game

**Setup:** Display terms and definitions separately. Teams race to match them correctly.

**Round 1 - Basic Terms (3 minutes):**
```
TERMS: Sum, Difference, Product, Quotient, Factor, Multiple
SCENARIOS:
- 15 ÷ 3 = 5 (Answer: quotient)
- 7 × 8 = 56 (Answer: product) 
- 12 - 5 = 7 (Answer: difference)
- 4 + 9 = 13 (Answer: sum)
- 6 is a ___ of 24 (Answer: factor)
- 20 is a ___ of 5 (Answer: multiple)
```

**Round 2 - Tricky Cases (3 minutes):**
```
CHALLENGE QUESTIONS:
1. "What's the difference between 15 and 3?" (Answer: 12)
2. "What's the difference between 3 and 15?" (Answer: 12 - same!)
3. "Is 1 prime, composite, or neither?" (Answer: neither)
4. "Name three consecutive odd numbers starting with 17" (Answer: 17, 19, 21)
```

## **Station 2: "Cracking the Number Code" (7 minutes)**

### **Challenge Type:** Number Properties Investigation

**Mission:** Teams receive mysterious numbers and must identify all their "secret properties."

**Example Mystery Numbers:**
- **Number: 121**
  - Properties to find: 3-digit, palindrome, perfect square (11²), composite
- **Number: 144** 
  - Properties to find: 3-digit, perfect square (12²), composite, digit sum = 9
- **Number: 17**
  - Properties to find: 2-digit, prime, odd

**Team Task:** For each number, teams must:
1. Identify if it's prime, composite, or neither
2. Check if it's a palindrome
3. Calculate digit sum
4. Find at least 2 factors (if composite)
5. Determine if it's a perfect square or cube

**Bonus Challenge:** "Create your own 3-digit palindrome that's also a perfect square!" (Answer examples: 121, 484, 676)

## **Station 3: "The Fraction Detective Files" (7 minutes)**

### **Challenge Type:** Fraction Classification & Operations

**Case Files:** Teams sort fraction "evidence" into categories:

**Evidence Box 1 - Fraction Types:**
```
Classify these fractions:
- 3/4 (proper fraction)
- 7/3 (improper fraction)  
- 1/5 (unit fraction)
- -2/3 (negative fraction - Division M)
- (2/3)/(1/4) (complex fraction)
```

**Evidence Box 2 - Real-World Applications:**
```
CRIME SCENE: A pizza was cut into 8 equal pieces
- If 3 pieces are eaten, what fraction represents what's left? (5/8)
- Is this a proper or improper fraction? (proper)
- What's the simplest form of 6/8? (3/4)
```

**Advanced Challenge (Division M):** 
"Convert these to simplest form: -12/18, 15/-20" (Answers: -2/3, -3/4)

---

## **Station 4: "The Great Statistics & Geometry Mystery" (7 minutes)**

### **Challenge Type:** Mixed Application Problems

**Part A - Statistics Detective Work (3 minutes):**
```
CASE: Test scores from a math class
Data: 85, 92, 78, 92, 88, 75, 92, 90

Find the:
- Average (mean): 87
- Mode: 92
- Median: 88.5
- Range: 17
```

**Part B - Geometry Crime Scene (4 minutes):**
```
EVIDENCE: Various shapes found at the scene

Teams must:
1. Identify shape types (triangle, quadrilateral, etc.)
2. Classify triangles: acute, right, obtuse; scalene, isosceles, equilateral
3. Identify special quadrilaterals: square, rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, trapezoid
4. Distinguish between congruent vs. similar figures
```

**Quick Challenge:** "Draw two shapes that are similar but not congruent" (e.g., squares of different sizes)

---

## **Final Challenge: "The Ultimate Number Mystery" (4 minutes)**

### **Whole-Class Competition**

**The Big Case:** Present a complex scenario requiring multiple vocabulary terms:

> **"Detective, we found this mysterious number: 1,331**
> 
> **Your final mission: Identify EVERYTHING about this number using proper MOEMS vocabulary!"**

**Expected discoveries:**
- 4-digit number
- Palindrome (reads same forwards/backwards)  
- Perfect cube (11³ = 1,331)
- Composite number
- Digit sum = 8
- Factors include: 1, 11, 121, 1331
- Odd number
- Multiple of 11

**Teams earn points for each correctly identified property using proper vocabulary.**

---

## **Wrap-Up: Detective Graduation (1 minute)**

### **Victory Ceremony**
- Announce winning team
- Quick vocabulary lightning round: Teacher calls out a number, teams shout its properties
- Remind students: "You're now equipped with the mathematical language that will help you excel in competitions!"

---

## **Assessment & Extensions**

**Quick Check:** Each student writes one sentence using at least 3 MOEMS vocabulary terms correctly.

**Homework Challenge:** "Find a number in your daily life (address, phone number, etc.) and describe it using 5+ MOEMS vocabulary terms."

**Competition Prep:** Use actual MOEMS problems for students ready for authentic practice.

---

## **Teacher Notes**
- Adjust difficulty based on class level (focus more on basic terms for grade 6, include Division M concepts for advanced grade 8)
- Encourage precise language: "18 divided by 3" vs "the quotient of 18 and 3"
- Emphasize that in competitions, vocabulary precision can determine whether an answer is accepted
