MATH LEAGUE MEET #3 - SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
Based on Meet #1 and Meet #2 Performance Analysis
==========================================================

🎯 ATTENDANCE & ENGAGEMENT
==========================================================

Critical Issue: 6 fewer students participated (42→36), with 10 students who attended
Meet #1 skipping Meet #2.

Recommendations:

1. PRE-MEET REMINDERS
   - Send reminder messages 1 week before and 2 days before Meet #3
   - Personalize messages to students who missed Meet #2
   - Emphasize it's not too late to participate

2. 6TH GRADE OUTREACH
   - Attendance dropped from 15→9 students
   - Personal check-in with 6th graders who missed Meet #2
   - Pair struggling 6th graders with 7th/8th grade mentors

3. MAKE-UP PARTICIPATION
   - Allow students who missed Meet #2 to still participate in Meet #3

4. ATTENDANCE INCENTIVES
   - Consider recognition for perfect attendance across all 4 meets


👥 TEAM ROSTER MANAGEMENT
==========================================================

Issue: 4 teams competed with incomplete rosters (5 or fewer members)

Recommendations:

1. TEAM RESTRUCTURING
   - Before Meet #3, reorganize teams to ensure 6 members each
   - Redistribute students from JV Mixed (only had 3) to other JV teams
   - Balance teams by skill level and grade

2. SUBSTITUTE SYSTEM
   - Create a "substitute list" of students who can fill in if teammates are absent

3. TEAM COMMUNICATION
   - Have team captains check with teammates 2 days before the meet


🏃 RELAY ROUND PERFORMANCE
==========================================================

Success: Relay 1 improved for 5/7 teams
Concern: Team C's Relay 2 collapsed (6→0)

Recommendations:

1. RELAY PRACTICE SESSIONS
   - Dedicate specific meeting time to relay practice
   - Practice passing answers efficiently
   - Time management drills
   - Error-checking strategies

2. TEAM C DEEP DIVE
   - Meet with Team C to understand what happened in Relay 2
   - Was it a conceptual difficulty? Time pressure? Communication issue?
   - Review the specific problems they struggled with

3. STUDY HALL PATTERN
   - Teams A and B both improved in relays - interview them about their strategies


📚 GRADE-LEVEL SUPPORT
==========================================================

Success: 7th grade improved significantly (2.92→3.33) 🎉
Concern: 6th grade declined (3.20→2.78)

Recommendations:

1. LEARN FROM 7TH GRADE SUCCESS
   - What did 7th graders do differently?
   - Share their preparation strategies with other grades

2. 6TH GRADE SUPPORT
   - Additional practice problems at appropriate difficulty
   - Focus on building confidence, not just skills
   - Celebrate small improvements, not just perfect scores

3. PEER TUTORING

📊 DATA-DRIVEN PREPARATION
